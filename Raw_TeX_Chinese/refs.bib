abstract = {So far, the optical pulses used in phase-sensitive OTDR (\&\#x03A6;OTDR) were typically engineered so as to have a constant phase along the pulse. In this work, it is demonstrated that by acting on the phase profile of the optical pulses, it is possible to introduce important conceptual and practical changes to the traditional \&\#x03A6;OTDR operation, thus opening a door for new possibilities which are yet to be explored. Using a \&\#x03A6;OTDR with linearly chirped pulses and direct detection, the distributed measurement of temperature/strain changes from trace to trace, with 1mK/4n\&\#x03B5; resolution, is theoreticaly and experimentaly demonstrated. The measurand resolution and sensitivity can be tuned by acting on the pulse chirp profile. The technique does not require a frequency sweep, thus greatly decreasing the measurement time and complexity of the system, while maintaining the potential for metric spatial resolutions over tens of kilometers as in conventional \&\#x03A6;OTDR. The technique allows for measurements at kHz rates, while maintaining reliability over several hours.},

Mackay (1967) orginally suggested this experiment to test if a dolphin could detect phase differences. An example of a typical sonar run showing the animal's position at 1 s intervals is presented on the left side of Fig. 1. Weisser, et al. (1967) examined the plates by insonifying them at normal incident angle using simulated dolphin echolocation signals. No obvious differences between echo waveforms were observed. Fish et al. (1976) demonstrated that instrumented human divers wearing a helmet with a sending and two receiving transducers could perform the discrimination task as well as or better than the dolphin. Broadband simulated dolphin clicks with energy centered at 60 kHz were projected and the echoes time-streched by a factor of 128 before presentation to the divers.",

ABSTRACT = {The safety monitoring and tracking of aircraft is becoming more and more important. Under aerodynamic loading, the aircraft wing will produce large bending and torsional deformation, which seriously affects the safety of aircraft. The variation of load on the aircraft wing directly affects the ground observation performance of the aircraft baseline. To compensate for baseline deformations caused by wing deformations, it is necessary to accurately obtain the deformation of the wing shape. The traditional aircraft wing shape measurement methods cannot meet the requirements of small size, light weight, low cost, anti-electromagnetic interference, and adapting to complex environment at the same time, the fiber optic sensing technology for aircraft wing shape measurement has been gradually proved to be a real time and online dynamic measurement method with many excellent characteristics. The principle technical characteristics and bonding technology of fiber Bragg grating sensors (FBGs) are reviewed in this paper. The advantages and disadvantages of other measurement methods are compared and analyzed and the application status of FBG sensing technology for aircraft wing shape measurement is emphatically analyzed. Finally, comprehensive suggestions for improving the accuracy of aircraft wing shape measurement based on FBG sensing technology is put forward.},

	abstract = {In the present communication we propose a novel approach to the realization of a phase sensitive optical time-domain reflectometer (OTDR) which is capable of a precise reconstruction of the phase signal which impacts the arbitrary point of a fiber-optic line. The method uses a dual-pulse probe signal with diverse carrier optical frequency within each half of the double pulse. The quasi-periodic intensity pattern which emerges as a result of double frequency backscattered signal interference contains the information of the external action over the fiber. The phase signal is extracted with the aid of an I/Q quadrature demodulation scheme, realized at the receiving side of the OTDR. The feasibility and limitations of the proposed scheme are theoretically proved and experimentally demonstrated.}

abstract = {We propose a novel approach to generate distributed fiber sensing system based on phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometer ($\Phi$-OTDR) and phase-generated carrier demodulation algorithm. An unbalanced Michelson interferometer is introduced at the receiving end of the system. The back Rayleigh scattering light from a certain position along the sensing fiber would interfere to generate interference light signal versus time, whose phase carries the sensing information. Phase-generated carrier demodulation algorithm is proposed and carried out to recover the phase information. A single frequency vibration event is applied to a certain position along the sensing fiber and we realize to demodulate it correctly. The noise level of the phase sensitive OTDR system is about {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater}               {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$3 \{\textblackslash\}times 10^\{-3\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}            {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} rad/{\textsurd}Hz and a signal to noise ratio about 30.45 dB is achieved.

It has taken fifty years from its earliest invention by conceptual discovery until today for SBS to become a practical and useful technology in a variety of applications. Some of these applications are explained and it is shown how they are tied to particular attributes of SBS: phase conjugation, frequency shifts, low noise, narrow linewidth, frequency combs, optical and microwave signal processing, etc.}

The optimum fiber length for maximum gain is determined experimentally. A limit in signal-to-noise ratio that is due to concurrent amplification of spontaneous emission is observed. By cooling the fiber to 77 K, the amplifier gain is increased to $+$29 dB as a result of depopulation of the lower laser level.},

By investigating the time–frequency dynamics of the pulse propagation, the underlying mechanism is analyzed.}

We formulate an effective procedure that leads directly, under appropriate conditions, to a wide range of exact asymptotic similariton solutions of NLSE demonstrating self-similar propagating regimes with linear chirp.},

	abstract = {A brief biographical introduction to Snellius (Snel van Royen) and his geodetic work is followed by a discussion of the historical background of his Amsterdam manuscript on optics. Here I present the first translation of the Latin original into any living language. It is preceded by a heuristic reconstruction of the path Snellius very likely took in finding the law of refraction named after him. My reconstruction essentially consists in the following five steps: Because of his geodetic work in which he pioneered the method of triangulation, Snellius already had considerable experience with trigonometric functions; indicative of this are the two allusions to geodesics in the Amsterdam manuscript, one of them directly before the law of refraction (see prop. 7 and prop. 22 of his book I). Other remarks in the manuscript reveal that Snellius had studied the existing literature on optics, particularly on refraction; various passages in the manuscript are analogous in formulation and sequence to other treatises as shown by his marginal notes and occasional references to other texts interspersed throughout the manuscript. Snellius showed special interest in Ibn al-Haitam's experimentum elegans (mentioned in prop. 22 of book I). He sought a geometrical description of the refractaria, (idem, prop. 36–39). This search led him to find the law of refraction in the secant form (idem, prop. 23).},

The new polarization state generator (PSG) leverages Kerr phase modulation in a birefringent optical fiber, creating a probe pulse characterized by temporally varying polarization. Theoretical expressions for the Polarization State Generator (PSG) Stokes vector are derived for birefringent walk-off and no walk-off and incorporated into a time-dependent polarimeter signal model employing multiple polarization state analyzers (PSA). Polarimeter modeling compares the Kerr effect and electro-optic phase modulator\&\#x2013;based PSG using a single Polarization State Analyzer (PSA) and a scattering sample yielding similarly good performance for both. We include results from an experimental demonstration of the Kerr effect PSG.},

abstract = {We present an all-optical technique for the stabilization of laser power using the nonlinear Kerr effect and experimentally demonstrate improvement of vibration recovery in direct-detection phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry (\&\#x03A6;-OTDR). A pulsed or continuous wave optical signal impressed with a sinusoidal modulation generates sidebands while experiencing self-phase modulation in a nonlinear medium which can be utilized to stabilize the peak power of the signal. By adjusting the peak power at the entrance of the Kerr medium, the signal created at the first order sideband exhibits reduced peak power fluctuations and can be extracted using a band-pass filter. Experimental results show that the generated pulses with stabilized peak power improve vibration detection in a \&\#x03A6;-OTDR with a direct-detection scheme. This technique can be combined with other performance enhancement techniques to allow for the detection of weak signals, and reduces the need of an optoelectronic-based power control loop on a fiber laser.},

A fluctuation of interest is impressed onto a sinusoidally modulated optical signals (SMOS) and spectral sidebands are generated as the SMOS experiences self-phase modulation in a nonlinear medium. Magnification of these temporal variation is obtained by filtering one of the sidebands. For small fluctuations, the amount of magnification obtained is proportional to (2m\&\#x2009;\&\#x002B;\&\#x2009;1), with m being the sideband order. This technique enhances fiber-based point sensor capabilities by bringing signals originally too small to be detected into the detection range of photodetectors.},

The ultra-linear sweep is realized using an external modulation method with a linearly swept radio frequency (RF) signal. The RF signal sweeps from 16 GHz to 19.3 GHz, and the slave laser is injection-locked to the 8th-order sideband of the master laser, achieving a frequency sweeping span of ~25 GHz. By using the injection-locked frequency-swept laser as the optical source of OFDR, we obtain a spatial resolution of 4.2 mm over 10-km measurement range. A polarization beat length of 10.5 cm is measured benefiting from the high spatial resolution. To improve the spatial resolution further, FWM process is used to broaden the frequency sweeping span. Frequency sweeping span of ~100 GHz is achieved with cascaded FWM. We demonstrate a 1.1-mm spatial resolution over 2-km measurement range with the proposed ultra-linearly swept optical source.},

In this paper, a simulation-based approach is developed, considering bending and twisting effects to assess the performance of the reflectometer in measuring plasma current at ITER. The results demonstrate that, for a proper choice of spun sensing fiber parameters (intrinsic beat length and spun period), the performance of the sensor satisfies ITER accuracy.},

High-$\epsilon$ pulses are generated by applying a square pulse modulation on sinusoidally modulated optical signals, then inducing self-phase modulation (SPM) using the nonlinear Kerr effect and extracting an SPM-generated sideband. We measured a 10 ns Kerr-generated optical pulse exhibiting a 120.1 dB extinction ratio, originating from a conventional electro-optic modulator delivering a pulse with a 20-dB extinction ratio, by counting the number of photons at the peak and the pedestal of the generated pulse. These proven high-$\epsilon$ pulses allow for long-range distributed vibration sensing in optical time-domain reflectometry systems and open new horizons in high-Q microring sensors.},

Optical computing provides a distinctive perspective to address this bottleneck by harnessing the unique properties of photons including broad bandwidth, low latency, and high energy efficiency. In this review, we introduce the latest developments of optical computing for different AI models, including feedforward neural networks, reservoir computing, and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Recent progress in integrated photonic devices, combined with the rise of AI, provides a great opportunity for the renaissance of optical computing in practical applications. This effort requires multidisciplinary efforts from a broad community. This review provides an overview of the state-of-the-art accomplishments in recent years, discusses the availability of current technologies, and points out various remaining challenges in different aspects to push the frontier. We anticipate that the era of large-scale integrated photonics processors will soon arrive for practical AI applications in the form of hybrid optoelectronic frameworks.}

By sweeping the frequency of a tunable laser across a fiber Bragg grating, a signal corresponding to the reflection spectrum of the FBG is generated. If another laser with fixed power and frequency is launched into a highly nonlinear fiber along with the FBG-shaped signal, the Kerr effect gives rise to a number of frequency sidebands, where the power in each of the sidebands is proportional an integer exponent of the signal and pump powers. By filtering out particular sidebands, this potentiation effect reduces the width of the FBG-shaped signal, making shifts in its central wavelength easier to distinguish. We report a maximum resolution enhancement factor of 3.35 obtained by extracting the n\&\#x2009;\&\#x003D;\&\#x2009;\&\#x2212;4 order sideband, and apply resolution enhancement to improve the resolution of an FBG based temperature sensor. The method described in this paper can be applied to existing fiber based sensors and optical systems to enhance their resolution.},

  abstract = {Broadband and low-noise microresonator frequency combs (microcombs) are critical for deployable optical frequency measurements. Here we expand the bandwidth of a microcomb far beyond its anomalous dispersion region on both sides of its spectrum through spectral translation mediated by mixing of a dissipative Kerr soliton and a secondary pump. We introduce the concept of synthetic dispersion to qualitatively capture the system's key physical behavior, in which the second pump enables spectral translation through four-wave mixing Bragg scattering. Experimentally, we pump a silicon nitride microring at 1063 nm and 1557 nm to enable soliton spectral translation, resulting in a total bandwidth of 1.6 octaves (137\textendash 407 THz). We examine the comb's low-noise characteristics, through heterodyne beat note measurements across its spectrum, measurements of the comb tooth spacing in its primary and spectrally translated portions, and their relative noise. These ultra-broadband microcombs provide new opportunities for optical frequency synthesis, optical atomic clocks, and reaching previously unattainable wavelengths.}

abstract = {Optical signal processing brings together various fields of optics and signal processing---namely, nonlinear devices and processes, analog and digital signals, and advanced data modulation formats---to achieve high-speed signal processing functions that can potentially operate at the line rate of fiber optic communications. Information can be encoded in amplitude, phase, wavelength, polarization and spatial features of an optical wave to achieve high-capacity transmission. We revisit advances in the key enabling technologies that led to recent research in optical signal processing for digital signals that are encoded in one or more of these dimensions. Various optical nonlinearities and chromatic dispersion have been shown to enable key sub-system applications such as wavelength conversion, multicasting, multiplexing, demultiplexing, and tunable optical delays. We review recent advances in high-speed optical signal processing applications in the areas of equalization, regeneration, flexible signal generation, and optical control information (optical logic and correlation).},

Comparing with single-channel detection in a conventional OFCS, a signal power gain of 6 dB and a signal-to-noise ratio improvement of over 30 dB have been achieved in the new scheme. The cavity amplifies magnetic field-induced nonreciprocal phase modulation, while the Faraday rotation mirrors suppress the reciprocal birefringence. A linear response is obtained for current amplitude as low as several mA at an AC frequency of 1 kHz.},

These properties are modified by the field under investigation. The technique appears feasible and could form the basis for a new measurement technology.},

abstract = {In Chirped Pulse $\phi$-OTDR systems used for sensing temperature or strain along an optical fiber, the largest disturbance between two single-shot measurements that can reliably be detected depends on the range of frequencies swept by the chirped pulse. If electrical modulation is used to generate the laser frequency sweep, the achievable sweeping range is limited by the electrical components, leading to a narrow measurement range for static measurements. In this work, we demonstrate the extension of the frequency range of a chirped laser pulse by all-optical means using evenly spaced frequency sidebands generated via the Kerr effect to improve the Chirped Pulse $\phi$-OTDR measurement range. We report chirp extensions by factors up to 13 and apply the effect to achieve a sixfold increase in the measurement range of a Chirped Pulse $\phi$-OTDR system measuring the temperature of a random fiber grating array. The method described in this paper can be applied to other optical systems utilizing chirped laser pulses and allow for variable extension of their chirping range.},

Due to the Kerr effect-induced sinusoidal phase modulation in the nonlinear fiber, high order Kerr pulse with a large chirping rate is generated. In the concept-proof experiments, the FCR of the mth Kerr pulse has been significantly improved by a factor of 2m$+$1. In addition, dynamic strain measurement along with a random fiber grating array (RFGA) sensor by using different order Kerr pulse is carried out for demonstrating a large strain measurement range with lower uncertainty sensing capability. Benefiting from the use of a single laser source and large FCR Kerr pulse, the system exhibits a 3.9 \&\#x00B5;\&\#x025B; static strain measurable range, 0.24 \&\#x00B5;\&\#x025B; measurement uncertainty by using \&\#x2212;4th order Kerr pulse that has an FCR up to 0.8 GHz/ns. Note that the FCR of the chirped pulse could be further enhanced by using larger FCR chirped pulse seed or choosing higher order Kerr pulses.},
