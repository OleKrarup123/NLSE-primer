\chapter{Self-Steepening}
\label{ch:SS}

Explain SS as higher order Taylor expansion of nonlinearity

\section{Explain peak delay}
%Higher refractive index at peak causes it to slow down.

\section{Chirp and spectral changes}
%Explain that the steepening of the back slope leads to a stronger blue chirp. 

\section{When does it matter?}
% Mention that it usually plays a "supportive role" in the GNLSE
